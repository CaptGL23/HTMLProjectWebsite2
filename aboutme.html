          <h2>Growing up</h2>
            <p>I am originally from Northern Ohio, about 30 minutes from Cleveland, Ohio. I started playing baseball when I was 3 years old and continued playing until I was 17. A lot of my free time growing up consisted of skateboarding, drawing, playing video games, and playing basketball for fun.</p>
          <h2>Adult Life</h2>
            <p>I met my wife when we were in high school and now we have been together almost 10 years and have 3 beautiful children. After high school, I attended <em>The University of Toledo</em> to get a Bachelor's degree in astrophysics. At the same time, I was attending the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) at <em>Bowling Green State University</em>. With having a wife and child, I couldn't afford to stay in school so my wife and I decided it was best if I enlisted in the Air Force and worked towards a degree. Six years later and here we are, finally working towards that degree.</p>

          <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
          <p>Gaming is really my only hobby, outside of work and family. One of the games I normally play is <strong>League of Legends</strong>. I tend to stream sometimes, if I have the chance. If you want to check out my stream or videos, the links will be below. When I can't play, I normally watch professional play. It is football season and I do enjoy keeping up with my teams, <strong><em>The Pittsburgh Steelers</em></strong> and <strong><em>The Cleveland Browns</em></strong></p>
